            <h2 class="intro-title">Reclaiming Our Vision: Project 2026</h2>
            
            <p>For too long, the Democratic Party has operated without a cohesive strategy, reacting to Republican narratives rather than proactively defining our own. We've become a coalition of special interests without a unifying message that resonates with everyday Americans.</p>
            
            <p>Project 2026 represents a bold experiment: leveraging artificial intelligence to help identify patterns, analyze feedback from diverse constituencies, and craft a more coherent policy platform. By processing vast amounts of information from voting patterns, demographic trends, and historical policy outcomes, AI has helped us see beyond our echo chambers and identify blind spots in our messaging.</p>
            
            <p>This isn't about abandoning our core values—it's about communicating them more effectively. It's about finding common ground between progressive ideals and pragmatic solutions that improve people's lives. It's about recognizing that Americans want a party that fights for both economic opportunity and personal freedom, for both innovation and stability.</p>
            
            <p>The proposals outlined here aren't final pronouncements but starting points for a broader conversation about who we are and what we stand for. Some may seem controversial within our traditional base, but each is designed to build bridges to voters who have felt alienated by our rhetoric while staying true to democratic principles.</p>
            
            <p>Together, we can build a Democratic Party that speaks to America's hopes rather than its fears—a party ready to lead in an era of unprecedented technological and social change. Project 2026 isn't just about winning elections; it's about governing effectively in the complex reality of 21st century America.</p>
            
            <p style="font-weight: 600; margin-top: 30px;">Let's get to work.</p>
